            <h2 class="title"> Aimee Zheng is a designer who specializes in oil painting and the surreal.</h2>
            <p>Based in Ann Arbor, Aimee Zheng is a sophomore at the University of Michigan currently 
                pursuing a dual-degree: a BBA through the Ross School of Business and a BSI 
                through the School of Information in the UI/UX track. </p>

            <p>In her journey of creating human-centric art, she is naturally drawn to documenting 
                the same central themes in the majority of her paintings, which is to explore 
                the many dualities present in our lives: inside/outside, before/after, and animal/human. 
                Each piece is an amalgamation of these. What is beauty? What is nature? She is curious about the 
                in-between, the journey of it all, and the unusual. Her favorite subject matter and pieces 
                have also always included a sense of the catharsis. 
            </p>
                
            <p>On campus, Aimee is also involved with a student consulting organization called BOND Consulting Group, 
                as well as a professional business fraternity, Phi Beta Lambda, where she operates as the VP of Communications.
                She has produced multiple pieces of art that have won awards in Scholastic Art Awards and other art 
                competitions, including book publications. Aimee has also pursued her artistic passions in ways that 
                serve her local community, as she independently founded and designed a program in 2018 to teach elementary 
                and middle school students how to create digital art.
