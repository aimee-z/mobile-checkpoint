        <div class = "oil">
            <img src = "images/greekportrait.jpg" alt = "Oil painting of a woman facing the side. She has curly
            ginger-brown hair that reflects backlighting."/>
            <p>I started my sustained investigation in 2016 with something I was familiar with: oil paint. I chose to leave 
                the paint strokes unblended, showing the individual marks made. I chose a warmer color scheme and a 
                fiery, back-lit effect.</p>
            <img src = "images/grayportrait.jpg" alt = "Oil painting of a woman with her eyes closed. Her skin 
            is gray and fades into the black background."/>
            <p>I painted this piece over an existing painting I didn't particularly like, and that proved to be 
                a particularly unique challenge; I had to work around the textures and layers of paint underneath. 
                With this one, I continued the theme of my previous paintings â€” solemn, individual women. 
                How does femininity affect how we perceive the world? I used a mix of harsh lines and soft 
                blending against the black background to make this portrait stand out, as well as leave some 
                of the burnt sienna of the underpainting show.</p>
            <img src = "images/water.jpg" alt = "Oil painting of a woman laying down in the water, with only her head and 
            one shoulder showing. Her reflection is muddled."/>
            <p>In this oil piece, I wanted to explore an individual's sense of self, and the duality of self-imaging. 
                I was influenced by my own experiences growing up, and acknowledging the fact that my own self-image 
                was often starkly different to others around me. I chose to paint abstractly, leaving wide strokes of color.</p>
            <img src = "images/heads.jpg" alt = "Oil painting of a person's bust with blobs for a head. There 
            is one eye in the blobs. The background is blue."/>
            <p>This is another oil painting I made; it's a bit of an off-shoot of the other two. I left the color 
                scheme behind, but the intense human portraiture remains. Looking back, though, I shouldn't have made the 
                background that blue/red mix. It contrasts with the colors of the focal point, which are muted skin tones.</p>
            <img src = "images/personal.jpg" alt = "Oil painting of a person's head. There is no hair, and the eyes 
            are covered with a smear of green and orange."/>
            <p>This piece was largely influenced by my own experiences over the course of last year, 
                through which I tried to express a lot of the conflict that I went through. I chose to use a 
                moody, overcast color palette with the exception of the eyes, where I used a palette knife for the 
                first time to create a chaotic, contrasting look. I used my own face as a loose reference.</p>
            <img src = "images/sideportrait.jpg" alt = "Oil painting of Chinese woman facing the left. Her eyes are
            completely white and her neck is red. There are two large red circles in the background."/>
            <p>This painting was meant to go along with my previous oil painting. I used the same color palette and 
                overarching theme, but I stopped before I added any of the orange/green paint with a palette knife, 
                even though I had planned on doing so originally. 

                I wanted to create something surreal again, and with this piece, I wanted to create something a little 
                human yet off-kilter. I ended up unhappy with this piece, as the skin looked incredibly splotchy 
                and the background was too empty. Even so, I stopped here to make sure I had enough pieces to submit for my portfolio.
                I came back in the summer of quarantine to finally update this piece, as it kept bothering me. I repainted both 
                the background as well as the skin, and gave the figure hair. I deepened shadows and added contrast to make this 
                feel much more finished.</p>
            <img src = "images/blues.jpg" alt = "Oil painting of a woman in monochromatic blue."/>
            <img src = "images/crow.jpg" alt = "Oil painting of a crow's head in monochromatic blue. There is 
            a yellow Rennaissance-style halo behind its head."/>
            <p>For this oil piece, which I painted for a charity, I had to think about creating something that people would 
                like as decoration. It was a fun exploration into something I felt would be more decorative and kitschy. I like 
                the monochrome blue color scheme and the muted yellow/orange halo in the back, and I tried to make 
                it a sketchier painterly piece.</p>
            <img src = "images/duet.jpg" alt = "Oil painting of two symmetric heads in monochromatic pink. 
            They have one eye and no hair. The background is blue and their bodies are in yellow."/>
            <p>I took the opportunity to paint on something a little unique, as my family was throwing away 
                an old desk. This was painted on one of the left-over panels. I played around with symmetry, 
                as well as my idea of the duality of personality. The bright colors were especially fun to paint.</p>
