            <img src = "images/dark.jpg" alt = "Digital portrait of a lady with black hair 
            standing in the dark. Two roses on her chest are making her bleed."/>
            <p>In this piece, I want to transfer the emotion of a blurry melancholy resisting 
                the harsh exposure of the light. The juxtaposition of the light against the haze 
                of fading away presents a feeling of vulnerability.</p>
            <img src = "images/internal.jpg" alt = "Digital piece of a woman laying down on
            the ground. Her body is split in half vertically, and pastel-shaded creatures
            are emerging from the bottom half of her body. She looks peaceful."/>
            <p>For this piece, I wanted to draw with a more illustrative/graphic design style, 
                with straight, even lines and a simple color scheme. With this, I wanted to create 
                something that would represent someone's inner struggles and 
                monsters, which are the strange creatures I drew coming out of the woman's 
                stomach. Similarly, she is split down the middle of her face to show the cracks 
                in her seemingly calm fa√ßade. I initially created the sketch on paper, then 
                transferred it onto PhotoShop to create the vivid colors. </p>
            <img src = "images/poster.jpg" alt = "Graphic design poster of Samurai Steakhouse.
            It is shaded in red. It is captioned: As seen on Channel 4!"/>
            <p>This is a poster commissioned by a local hibachi restaurant. 
                I chose a simple and bold look to represent this restaurant. </p>
            <img src = "images/scribble.jpg" alt = "Graphic design poster captioned: transform and open.
            It is shaded in orange."/>
            <p>I made this poster on Photoshop for a design contest. I wanted to go for a graphic, modern look to 
                characterize the broad statement of "Transform and Open," which was the prompt given.
                The girl represents our desire for change: though we may look content, our hearts all 
                grasp for control of our surroundings to make it better. The strings tie her 
                to those feelings and statement. I tinkered with how I could use minimalist 
                designs and color choice to convey my message. I played with multiple designs and 
                compositions and ended up with this as my final piece. </p>
            <img src = "images/turnaround.jpg" alt =  "Character design sheet, showing one woman
            in 4 different angles. She has black hair and is wearing a red dress."/>
            <p>I used Photoshop to create this turnaround for a character sheet. I learned many 
                of the tools in digital art through this, such as layering, shading, and all the 
                tips and tricks: most importantly, pressing shift to create a multiple straight 
                horizontal lines in a turnaround. Although I deleted them in the final product, 
                these horizontal lines are essential to creating a proper turnaround, as it allows 
                for us to create consistency with height. I exaggerated many of her features and 
                heavily relied on shapes as a foundation.</p>
